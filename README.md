# Bayesian-Testing


In this project, I explored the significance of Bayesian testing as an advanced alternative to traditional A/B testing. Unlike A/B testing, which relies on fixed thresholds for decision-making, Bayesian testing offers a more flexible and probabilistic approach, allowing for continuous learning and updating of beliefs as new data comes in. This method provides richer insights, such as the probability of one variant being better than the other, rather than just a binary yes/no decision. The Bayesian approach enhances decision-making, especially in scenarios where the cost of incorrect conclusions is high, making it a valuable tool in optimizing user experiences and business strategies.
